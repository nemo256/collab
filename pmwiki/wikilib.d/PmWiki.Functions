For a more brief list/overview on functions useful to for instance cookbook writers, see Cookbook:Functions. %0a%0aTo use this functions you have to make sure that all relevant internal variables have been initialized correctly. See [[Custom Markup]] and [[(PmWiki:)Custom Actions]] for more information on how these functions are typically called via [@Markup()@] or [@$HandleActions[]@].%0a%0a!! [[#pmcrypt]] [@pmcrypt($password, $salt = null)@]%0aThe pmcrypt() function is intended to be a safe replacement for the [[http://php.net/crypt|PHP 5.6+ crypt() function]] without providing a $salt, which would raise a notice. If a salt is provided, crypt() is called to check an existing password. If a salt is not provided,  [[http://php.net/password_hash|password_hash()]] will be called to create a cryptographically strong password hash.%0a%0a!! [[#pmsetcookie]] [@pmsetcookie($name, $val="", $exp=0, $path="", $dom="", $secure=null, $httponly=null)@]%0a%0aThis function is intended as a replacement for [[http://php.net/setcookie|setcookie()]]. It will automatically set the $secure and $httponly arguments if they are not set by the caller function and if $EnableCookieSecure and $EnableCookieHTTPOnly are enabled.%0a%0a!![[#PCCF]] [@PCCF($php_code, $callback_template='default', $callback_arguments = '$m')@] %25red%25 Deprecated since PHP 7.2%25%25%0aThe PCCF() function (''PmWiki Create Callback Function'') can be used to create callback functions used with [[(http://php.net/)preg_replace_callback]]. It is required for PHP 5.5, but will also work with earlier PHP versions.%0a%0aThe first argument is the PHP code to be evaluated. %0a%0aThe second argument (optional) is the callback template, a key from the global $CallbackFnTemplates array. There are two templates that can be used by recipe authors: %0a* 'default' will pass $php_code as a function code%0a* 'return' will wrap $php_code like "return $php_code;" (since PmWiki 2.2.62)%0a%0aThe third argument (optional) is the argument of the callback function. Note that PmWiki uses the '$m' argument to pass the matches of a regular expression search, but your function can use other argument(s).%0a%0aPCCF() will create an anonymous (lambda) callback function containing the supplied code, and will cache it. On subsequent calls with the same $php_code, PCCF() will return the cached function name.%0a%0aSee http://php.net/create_function.%0a%0a>>font-style=italic%3c%3c%0aPHP 7.2 deprecates create_function() and future versions will remove it. If you need to migrate older code that used PCCF(), you can usually write regular functions and pass the function name where you previously passed the result of PCCF(). For example, suppose you had a pattern like this:%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/' => PCCF("return strtoupper(\$m[1]);"),%0a%0aFor PHP 7.2 compatibility, you can write a callback function:%0a  function %25green%25my_callback%25%25($m) { return strtoupper($m[1]); }%0a%0athen change the pattern to look like this:%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/' => '%25green%25my_callback%25%25',%0a%0aSee also: the recipe [[(Cookbook:)PccfToPcfOverride]] allows existing recipes to run on PHP 7 without causing deprecated create_function() messages.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!![[#PPRA]] [@PPRA($array_search_replace, $string)@]%0aThe PPRA() function (''PmWiki preg_replace array'') can be used to perform a regular expression replacement with or without evaluation, for PHP 5.5 compatibility. %0a%0aSince PmWiki 2.2.56, PmWiki uses this function to process the following arrays: $MakePageNamePatterns, $FmtP, $QualifyPatterns, $ROEPatterns, $ROSPatterns, $SaveAttrPatterns, $MakeUploadNamePatterns. Any custom settings should continue to work for PHP 5.4 and earlier, but wikis running on PHP 5.5 may need to make a few changes.%0a%0aThe first argument contains the 'search'=>'replace' pairs, the second is the  "haystack" string to be manipulated.%0a%0aThe 'replace' parts of the array can be strings or function names. If the 'replace' part is a callable function name, it will be called with the array of matches as a first argument via preg_replace_callback(). If not a callable function, a simple preg_replace() will be performed.%0a%0aPreviously, PmWiki used such constructs:%0a  $fmt = preg_replace(array_keys($FmtP), array_values($FmtP), $fmt);%0a%0aIt is now possible to use simply this:%0a  $fmt = PPRA($FmtP, $fmt);%0a%0aNote that since PHP 5.5, the search patterns cannot have an /e evaluation flag. When creating the $array_search_replace array, before PHP 5.5 we could use something like (eg. for $MakePageNamePatterns):%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/e' => "strtoupper('$1')",%0a%0aSince PHP 5.5, we should use this (will also work in PHP 5.4 and earlier):%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/' => PCCF("return strtoupper(\$m[1]);"),%0a%0aNote that the /e flag should be now omitted, instead of '$0', '$1', '$2', we should use $m[0], $m[1], $m[2], etc. in the replacement code, and there is no need to call PSS() in the replacement code, as backslashes are not automatically added.%0a%0a>>font-style=italic%3c%3c%0aFor PHP 7.2 and newer, instead of using PCCF() to create anonymous functions, we add a real function in our add-on, and then pass the function name as the pattern replacement (see example at [[#PCCF|PCCF]], which will also work on PHP 4 and 5):%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/' => '%25green%25my_callback%25%25',%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!![[#PPRE]] [@PPRE($search_pattern, $replacement_code, $string)@] %25red%25 Deprecated since PHP 7.2%25%25%0aThe PPRE() function (''PmWiki preg_replace evaluate'') can be used to perform a regular expression replacement with evaluation.%0a%0aSince PHP 5.5, the preg_replace() function has deprecated the /e evaluation flag, and displays warnings when the flag is used. The PPRE() function automatically creates a callback function with the replacement code and calls it.%0a%0aBefore PHP 5.5, it was possible to use such calls:%0a  $fmt = preg_replace('/\\$([A-Z]\\w*Fmt)\\b/e','$GLOBALS["$1"]',$fmt);%0a%0aSince PHP 5.5, it is possible to replace the previous snippet with the following (also works before PHP 5.5):%0a  $fmt = PPRE('%25green%25/\\$([A-Z]\\w*Fmt)\\b/%25%25','$GLOBALS[$m[1]]',$fmt);%0a%0aNote that the /e flag should be now omitted, instead of '$0', '$1', '$2', we should use $m[0], $m[1], $m[2], etc. in the replacement code, and there is no need to call PSS() in the replacement code, as backslashes are not automatically added.%0a%0a>>font-style=italic%3c%3c%0aFor PHP 7.2 and newer, calling this function will raise "deprecated" notices. You need to rewrite your code to use [[(http://php.net/)preg_replace_callback]], by moving the code into real functions:%0a%0a  $fmt = preg_replace_callback('%25green%25/\\$([A-Z]\\w*Fmt)\\b/%25%25', 'my_global_var_callback',$fmt);%0a  function my_global_var_callback($m) { return $GLOBALS[$m[1]]; }%0a%0ainstead of using PCCF() to create anonymous functions, we add a real function in our add-on, and then pass the function name as the pattern replacement (see example at [[#PCCF|PCCF]], which will also work on PHP 4 and 5):%0a  '/(?%3c=^| )([a-z])/' => '%25green%25my_callback%25%25',%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!![[#Qualify]] [@Qualify($pagename, $text)@]%0aQualify() applies $QualifyPatterns to convert relative links and references into absolute equivalents.%0aThis function is called by usual wiki markups that include text from other pages.%0aIt will rewrite links like [@[[Page]]@] into [@[[Group/Page]]@], and page (text) variables like [@{$Title}@] into [@{Group.Page$Title}@]%0aso that they work the same way in the source page and in the including page.%0aSee also $QualifyPatterns and @@[[({$Name}#)RetrieveAuthSection]]()@@.%0a%0a%0a!![[#PHSC]] [@PHSC($string_or_array, $flags=ENT_COMPAT, $encoding=null, $double_encode=true)@]%0aThe PHSC() function (''PmWiki HTML special characters'') is a replacement for the PHP function [[(http://php.net/)htmlspecialchars]]. %0a%0aThe htmlspecialchars() function was modified since PHP 5.4 in two ways: it now requires a valid string for the supplied encoding, and it changes the default encoding to UTF-8. This can cause sections of the page to become blank/empty on many sites using the ISO-8859-1 encoding without having set the third argument ($encoding) when calling htmlspecialchars().%0a%0aThe PHSC() function calls htmlspecialchars() with an 8-bit encoding as third argument, whatever the encoding of the wiki (unless you supply an encoding). This way the string never contains invalid characters.%0a%0aIt should be safe for recipe developers to replace all calls to htmlspecialchars() with calls to PHSC(). Only the first argument is required when calling PHSC(), although authors may wish to call PHSC($string_or_array, ENT_QUOTES).%0a%0aUnlike htmlspecialchars(), the PHSC() function can process arrays recursively (only the values are converted, not the keys of the array).%0a%0a!![[#PSS]] [@PSS($string)@]%0a%0aThe PSS() function (''PmWiki Strip Slashes'') removes the backslashes that are%0aautomatically inserted in front of quotation marks by%0athe /e option of PHP's preg_replace function.  PSS() is%0amost commonly used in replacement arguments to Markup(),%0awhen the pattern specifies /e and one or more of the %0aparenthesized subpatterns could contain a quote or backslash.  %0a("PSS" stands for "PmWiki Strip Slashes".)%0a-->From PM: PmWiki expects PSS() to always occur inside of double-quoted strings and to contain single quoted strings internally.  The reason for this is that we don't want the $1 or $2 to accidentally contain characters that would then be interpreted inside of the double-quoted string when the PSS is evaluated.%0a--->@@Markup('foo', 'inline', '/(something)/e', 'Foo(PSS("$1"))');  # wrong@@%0a--->@@Markup('foo', 'inline', '/(something)/e', "Foo(PSS('$1'))");  # right@@%0a%0a%25note%25 Note, the extra slashes are only added by @@preg_replace@@ with an @@/e@@ modifier. The markup definitions with @@Markup_e()@@ do NOT need to use PSS() in the replacement strings. The new-type markup definitions with @@Markup()@@ and a simple function name as a replacement do NOT need to use PSS() inside the replacement function. If you migrate old markup rules to the new format, delete the @@PSS()@@ calls.%0a%0a!!! Example%0aThis is a fictitious example where PSS() should be used.%0aLet us assume that you wish to define a directive [@(:example:)@]%0asuch that [@(:example "A horse":)@] results in the HTML%0a-> [@%3cdiv>"A horse"%3c/div>@].%0aHere is how the markup rule can be created:%0a-> [@%0aMarkup('example', 'directives',%0a       '/\\(:example\\s(.*?):\\)/e',%0a       "Keep('%3cdiv>'.PSS('$1').'%3c/div>')");%0a@]%0aWe need to use PSS() around the '$1' because the matched text%0acould contain quotation marks, and the /e will add backslashes%0ain front of them.%0a%0a!![[#stripmagic]] [@stripmagic($string)@]%0a%0aThis function should be used when processing the contents of [@$_POST@] or [@_GET@] variables when they could contain quotes or backslashes. It verifies [@get_magic_quotes()@], if true, strips the automatically inserted escapes from the string.%0a%0aThe function can process arrays recursively (only the values are processed).%0a%0a!![[#FmtPageName]] [@FmtPageName@]($fmt, $pagename)%0a%0a[[#FmtPageName-desc]]Returns [@$fmt@], with $variable and [=$[internationalisation]=] substitutions performed, under the assumption that the current page is [@pagename@]. See [[PmWiki.Variables]] for an (incomplete) list of available variables, [[PmWiki.Internationalizations]] for internationalisation.  Security: not to be run on user-supplied data.%0a%0aThis is one of the major functions in PmWiki, see [[PmWiki.FmtPageName]] for%0alots of details.%0a%0a%0a!![[#Markup]] [@Markup@]($name, $when, $pattern, $replace)%0a%0a[[#Markup-desc]]Adds a new markup to the conversion table.  Described in greater detail at [[PmWiki.CustomMarkup]].%0a%0aThis function is used to insert translation rules into the PmWiki's%0atranslation engine. The arguments to [@Markup()@] are all strings, where:%0a%0a:[@$name@]: The string names the rule that is inserted.  If a rule of the same name already exists, then this rule is ignored.%0a:[@$when@]: This string is used to control ''when'' a rule is to be applied relative to other rules.  A specification of "[@%3cxyz@]" says to apply this rule prior to the rule named "xyz", while "[@>xyz@]" says to apply this rule after the rule "xyz".  See [[(PmWiki:)CustomMarkup]] for more details on the order of rules.%0a:[@$pattern@]: This string is a [[regular expression -> http://www.php.net/preg_replace]] that is used by the translation engine to look for occurences of this rule in the markup source.%0a:[@$replace@]: This string will replace the matched text when a match occurs, or the function name that will return the replacement text.%0a%0aAlso see: [[PmWiki.CustomMarkup]] and [[Cookbook:Functions#Markup]]%0a%0a!![[#MarkupToHTML]] [@MarkupToHTML@]($pagename, $str)%0a%0a[[#MarkupToHTML-desc]] Converts the string [@$str@] containing PmWiki markup into the corresponding HTML code, assuming the current page is [@$pagename@].%0a%0aAlso see: [[Cookbook:Functions#MarkupToHTML]]%0a%0a!![[#mkdirp]] [@mkdirp@]($dir)%0a%0aThe function [@mkdirp@]($dir) creates a directory, [@$dir@], if it doesn't%0aalready exist, including any parent directories that might be needed.  For%0aeach directory created, it checks that the permissions on the directory are%0asufficient to allow PmWiki scripts to read and write files in that%0adirectory.  This includes checking for restrictions imposed by PHP's%0asafe_mode setting.  If [@mkdirp@]() is unable to successfully create a%0aread/write directory, [@mkdirp@]() aborts with an error message telling the%0aadministrator the steps to take to either create $dir manually or give%0aPmWiki sufficient permissions to be able to do it.%0a%0a!![[#MakeLink]] [@MakeLink@]($pagename, $target, $txt, $suffix, $fmt)%0a%0aThe function [@MakeLink@]($pagename, $target, $txt, $suffix, $fmt) returns an html-formatted anchor link. Its arguments are as follows:%0a $pagename is the source page%0a $target is where the link should go%0a $txt is the value to use for '$LinkText' in the output %0a $suffix is any suffix string to be added to $txt%0a $fmt is a format string to use%0a%0aIf $txt is NULL or not specified, then it is automatically computed from $target.%0a%0aIf $fmt is NULL or not specified, then MakeLink uses the default%0aformat as specified by the type of link.  For page links this%0ameans the $LinkPageExistsFmt and $LinkPageCreateFmt variables,%0afor intermap-style links it comes from either the $IMapLinkFmt%0aarray or from $UrlLinkFmt.  Inside of the formatting strings,%0a$LinkUrl is replaced by the resolved url for the link, $LinkText%0ais replaced with the appropriate text, and $LinkAlt is replaced%0aby any "title" (alternate text) information associated with the%0alink.%0a%0aAlso see: [[PmWiki:MakeLink]] and [[Cookbook:Functions#MakeLink]]%0a%0a!![[#MakeUploadName]] [@MakeUploadName@]($pagename, $x)%0a%0a@@MakeUploadName()@@ simply takes a string @@$x@@ (representing an attachment's%0aname) and converts it to a valid name by removing any unwanted characters.%0aIt also requires the name to begin and end with an alphanumeric character,%0aand as of 2.0.beta28 it forces any file extensions to lowercase.%0aThis function is defined in @@scripts/upload.php@@ and only used when uploads%0aare enabled.%0a%0a!![[#SessionAuth]] [@SessionAuth@]($pagename, $auth=NULL)%0a%0a@@SessionAuth()@@ manages keeping authentication via cookie-sessions. Session contains%0aever password or vaidated id and associated groups from previous calls.It adds%0aelements passed by @@$auth@@ to session. It also writes every element%0asaved in session to @@$AuthPw@@(passwords) and @@$AuthList@@(ids and groups).%0a%0a!![[#IsAuthorized]] [@IsAuthorized@]($chal, $source, &$from)%0a@@IsAuthorized@@ takes a pageattributesstring (e. g. "id:user1 $1$Ff3w34HASH...") in @@$chal@@.%0a@@$source@@ is simply returned and used for building the authcascade (pageattributes - groupattributes - %0a@@$DefaultPassword@@). @@$from@@ will be returned if @@$chal@@ is empty, because it is not checked %0abefore calling @@IsAuthorized()@@, this is needed for the authcascade. @@IsAuthorized()@@ returns an array%0awith three values: @@$auth@@ @@1@@ - authenticated, @@0@@ - not authenticated, @@-1@@ - refused; @@$passwd@@; %0a@@$source@@ from the parameter list.%0a%0a!![[#CondAuth]] [@CondAuth@] ($pagename, 'auth level')%0a[@CondAuth@] implements the [[ConditionalMarkup]] for [@(:if auth level:)@]. For instance [@ CondAuth($pagename,'edit')@] is true if authorization level is 'edit'. Use inside local configuration files to build conditionals with a check of authorization level, similar to using [@(:if auth level:)@] on a wiki page.%0a%0aNote that CondAuth() should be called after all authorization levels and passwords have been defined. For example, if you use it with [[Drafts]], you should include the draft.php script before calling CondAuth():%0a[@%0a   $EnableDrafts = 1;%0a   $DefaultPasswords['publish'] = pmcrypt('secret');%0a   include_once("$FarmD/scripts/draft.php");%0a   if (!

(This can be %0aespecially important for things such as searching and page listings.)%0aHowever, if combined with UpdatePage, the updated page will have no history.%0a%0aUse e.g. [@$page = @RetrieveAuthPage('Main.MyPage', 'read')@] to obtain a page object that contains all the information of the correspondent file in separate keys, e.g. [@$page['text']@] will contain a string with the current wiki markup of Main.MyPage. Use this generally in preference to the alternative function [@ReadPage($pagename, $since=0)@] since it respects the authorisation of the user, i.e. it checks the authorisation level before loading the page, or it can be set to do so. [@ReadPage()@] reads a page regardless of permission.%0a%0aPassing 'ALWAYS' as the authorization level (instead of 'read', 'edit', etc.) will cause RetrieveAuthPage to always read and return the page, even if it happens to be protected by a read password.%0a%0a%0a!! [[#RetrieveAuthSection]] @@RetrieveAuthSection($pagename, $pagesection, $list=NULL, $auth='read')@@%0aRetrieveAuthSection extracts a section of text from a page.
